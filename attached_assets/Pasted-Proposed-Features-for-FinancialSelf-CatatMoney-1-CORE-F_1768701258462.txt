Proposed Features for "FinancialSelf" (CatatMoney)
1. CORE FEATURE: "The Smart Allocator" (NLP Automation)
Stop forcing users to calculate percentages like 58% Needs or 13% Living manually. Let the app handle the math instantly.

How it Works:

Input: Weekly Income: Rp 720,000.

Action: The app automatically splits the funds into virtual "Cards":

🟦 NEEDS (58%): Rp 417,600

🟨 LIVING (13%): Rp 93,600

🟩 PLAYING (17%): Rp 122,400

🚀 BOOSTER (Remainder): Rp 86,400

Why You Need It: It eliminates "payday paralysis"—no more wondering how much to transfer or how much is left to spend.

2. UNIQUE FEATURE: "Variable Budget Slider"
How it Works: In the "Playing/Date" menu, provide a toggle or slider.

Modes: Frugal (Max 50k) | Normal (Max 100k) | High Roller (Max 150k).

Logic: If the user slides to "High Roller," the app triggers a warning: "Careful! Your Emergency Fund for this week will drop by Rp 50k. Proceed?"

Why You Need It: It visualizes consequences. If you choose to overspend, you see exactly which savings goal is being sacrificed.

3. VISUAL FEATURE: "The Dump Bin" (Wishlist Jar)
How it Works: A quick-access button titled "Leftover Change."

Input: 20,000 (Saved from gas/bensin).

Target Selection: [ ] New Keyboard | [ ] Monitor | [ ] Emergency Fund.

Visual: Displays a Progress Bar for the goal (e.g., Monitor: 15% Complete).

Why You Need It: Gamifies saving. It turns "frugal living" into a game where you are excited to save gas money just to see the progress bar fill up.

4. PRIORITY FEATURE: "Debt Destroyer" (Debt Tracker)
How it Works:

Display: Total Debt: Rp 3,500,000.

Action: Every time a "Debt Payment" expense is logged, the bar shrinks.

Reality Check: If a user logs a "New Monitor" expense while debt is still high, a cheeky pop-up appears: "Are you sure? You still owe 2 million, bro."

Why You Need It: Keeps your financial priorities sane and keeps you accountable.

5. ANALYTICS FEATURE: "Net Worth Reality Check"
Users often feel "broke" when their wallet is empty, even if their savings are growing elsewhere.

How it Works: The main dashboard shows more than just "Wallet Balance." It displays your TOTAL NET WORTH: (SeaBank Balance + Wallet Cash + Envelope Savings) - (Remaining Debt).

Why You Need It: To help you realize your assets are actually growing, even when your physical pocket money feels low.
